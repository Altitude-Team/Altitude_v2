# Aegis

**A powerful decentralized platform for digital distribution on macOS**

Aegis is a comprehensive software solution designed to simplify the management and installation of packages on macOS and be a viable alternative to the AppStore. 

Aegis includes a user-friendly interface coupled with powerful functionality such as the ability to install packages from a variety of sources. It allows the user to download and manage a variety of software from an official source under “safe” mode, or the installation and managing of system modifications and downloads from third party servers under “full” mode. 

- Developers can host their software on their own servers and distribute through Aegis by following the developer guide.
- A user setup guide is also included in this repository.

This project is a collection of proof-of-concept systems being the package manager Aegis, the repository system (which together with the manager form the digital distribution platform), and the framework for code injection based system modifications.

**THIS PROJECT IS NOW IN RELEASE BUILDS AND THEREFORE HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC**

The user is completely responsible for any damage that stems from improper usage and third-party software downloaded through Aegis. 
Ethereus takes no responsibility for such damage.
